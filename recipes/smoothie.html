    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Supercharge your morning with the best green smoothie recipe using sweet mango, creamy banana, and nutrient-packed spinach. Green smoothies come together in just 5 minutes to give you a delicious, energizing, and nourishing option to start the day.  </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup spinach</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup pineapple frozen </li>
        <li>½ cup mango frozen</li>
        <li>1 banana</li>
 
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure: Tightly pack spinach in a measuring cup.</li>
        <li>Add: Put spinach to blender with water. Blend together until all chunks are gone. (Should resemble green water when blended well).</li>
        <li>Toss: Pineapple, mango and banana to blender. I like to use frozen pineapple and mangos to chill the smoothie down and save time cutting and prepping. It’s a win-win!</li>
        <li>Blend: It all together until smooth and creamy. Depending on your blender, this could take as little as 30 seconds or as long as 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour: Into a glass and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
